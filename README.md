# ISIS
Nothing to do with the Islamic State; a repository to hold data and workflows for In Silico Immunogenicity Studies based on the tools from IEDB


# Todo
- Interface with eCIS database for orthologue clustering analyses
- Interface with chimera for 3D mapping to protein structures
- Alignment engine for orthologue alignments and scores on a per amino basis
- Codon redundancy back translation for optimised sequences 


# Workflow

## Linear B-Cell epitope prediction
`http://tools.iedb.org/bcell/help/#Bepipred`

HMMs combined with a propensity scale method that allows for thresholding and scores to be assigned to the antigenicity of a particular sequence.
